# Domain Knowledge: Chart of Accounts and Ledger Model

## Account Types and Normal Balances

The ledger is organized into five account types, each with a normal (expected) balance direction:

| Type | Normal Balance | Example |
|------|---|---|
| **Asset** | Debit | Cash, Checking, Accounts Receivable |
| **Liability** | Credit | Credit Card, Accounts Payable, Loans |
| **Equity** | Credit | Owner's Capital, Retained Earnings |
| **Income** | Credit | Revenue, Sales, Investment Income |
| **Expense** | Debit | Salary, Rent, Supplies, Food |

**Double-entry principle:** Every transaction posts at least two splits (debit and credit) to different accounts, such that debits always equal credits.

## Chart of Accounts Structure

The default chart has five root accounts (one per type):

- `Assets` (type: asset)
- `Liabilities` (type: liability)
- `Equity` (type: equity)
- `Income` (type: income)
- `Expenses` (type: expense)

Sub-accounts are created using colon-path notation: `Assets:Checking`, `Expenses:Food:Groceries`, etc. Parent accounts are auto-created if missing.

### Uncategorized accounts (Issue #2 — Ingestion)

`Expenses:Uncategorized` and `Income:Uncategorized` are part of the working chart. Ingested
transactions post as real, balanced double-entry transactions against these accounts (or a matched
category account if auto-categorization applies; see below) rather than being held outside the ledger
as pending drafts.

As of issue #11, `log_transaction` and `import_csv` consult learned vendor rules at ingestion time.
A high-confidence rule (`hits >= 2`) matching the payee/description will auto-post the transaction
directly to the matched category account (if its type matches the transaction kind: expense→expense
account, income→income account), skipping the Uncategorized round-trip entirely. This provides
immediate categorization for known vendors. Transactions with no matching rule, low-confidence rules,
or type mismatches still post to `Expenses:Uncategorized` or `Income:Uncategorized` as before. Issue #4
(categorization) tools can later re-categorize Uncategorized splits or correct already-categorized ones.

### Duplicate detection tolerance (Issue #2 — Ingestion)

`log_transaction` and `import_csv` share a duplicate-detection heuristic: a candidate entry is a
likely duplicate of an existing transaction if, within a date window (default ± 3 days) of the
candidate date, an existing transaction has a split on the same account for the *exact* same
signed amount (minor units), and its description fuzzy-matches the candidate's (normalized
lowercase/alphanumeric comparison; match if one normalized string contains the other, or they
share a token of length ≥ 4). This is a heuristic, not exact — matches are always surfaced for
confirmation rather than silently skipped or silently posted (see `AGENTS.md` hard rule 5).

### Source file reference (Issue #3 — Receipt Capture)

Every transaction has an optional `source_path` column (nullable, stored as `TEXT` in the ledger).
For transactions posted via `read_receipt` → `capture_receipt`, the `source_path` column retains
the file path to the original receipt/invoice image (e.g., `data/inbox/receipt1.jpg`), providing
an audit trail linking the ledger entry to its source document. Transactions posted via
`post_transaction`, `log_transaction`, or `import_csv` have `source_path = NULL` unless explicitly
provided. The path is stored as given (resolved from `cwd`), not validated or moved during posting;
it is the operator's responsibility to ensure the path is valid and the file is retained.

## File Format Support (Issue #3 — Receipt Capture, Issue #12 — PDF Support)

The `read_receipt` tool supports **image and PDF files:**
- **Supported:** PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, PDF (first page only)
- **Not supported:** Other document/office formats (e.g. DOCX, XLSX)

PDF files are rasterized to PNG using the `pdf-to-img` library. Multi-page PDFs extract the first
page only; the response includes a note if the PDF has more than one page. Corrupted or
password-protected PDFs are rejected with a clear error. Other unsupported formats are explicitly
rejected with a clear error message.

## Currency and Precision

- **Base currency:** USD (configurable in `config/settings.yaml`)
- **Precision:** 2 decimal places (cents); all monetary amounts are stored as integer minor units (cents) internally.
- **Fiscal year:** Calendar year (January–December; refinable in future issues)

## Key Concepts

- **Normal balance:** The direction (debit or credit) that increases an account. E.g., Assets increase with debits, Liabilities with credits.
- **Natural balance:** The balance shown to a user, always positive when the account is "full" (e.g., a $100 checking account shows +100, not -100). The raw database sum is adjusted by the normal balance direction.
- **Balanced transaction:** A transaction where total debits == total credits (always sums to zero in the database).

## Reporting and Financial Statements (Issue #5)

The `reporting` extension provides four tools for financial analysis and tax compliance:
- `spending_by_category` — hierarchical expense breakdown with drill-down
- `income_statement` — P&L for a date range
- `balance_sheet` — Assets = Liabilities + Equity (with retained earnings calculation)
- `tax_year_export` — CSV export of income/expense splits for tax preparation

All reports read from the ledger without modifying it; no closing entries are posted (retained earnings is calculated at report time).

## Bank Reconciliation (Issue #22)

`reconcile_account` matches bank statement lines (balance-only or CSV) against ledger splits using
tiered matching: Tier 1 is exact amount + date within a window (default ±3 days); Tier 2 (fallback,
unmatched rows only) is exact amount + fuzzy description match, reusing the same normalization and
tolerance as the ingestion duplicate-detection heuristic above. Confirmed matches are recorded in
separate `reconciliation_runs`/`reconciliations` tables, not by mutating `splits` — reconciliation
never touches the append-only ledger tables. `verify_ledger` is a separate, always-read-only
integrity check (unbalanced transactions, orphan splits, trial balance, unexpected-sign account
balances) usable independent of reconciliation.

## Accounts Receivable and Invoicing (Issue #23)

Invoices use the existing chart of accounts rather than a separate subledger: each customer gets an
`Assets:Accounts Receivable:<Customer>` sub-account (auto-created on first invoice), and an invoice
is simply a transaction debiting that account and crediting an income account of the operator's
choice. Because that AR account is shared across all of a customer's invoices, the `source_path`
column (see "Source file reference" above) does double duty here: both the invoice-posting
transaction and every payment transaction against it carry the invoice's JSON storage path as
`source_path`, which is how one specific invoice's balance is distinguished from the customer's
overall AR balance. Invoice metadata (line items, dates) lives outside the ledger as one JSON file
per invoice under `memory/invoices/`, numbered `INV-<year>-<seq>` (sequence resets per calendar
year). Status (open/partially paid/paid/overdue) is never stored — it's computed on demand from the
linked splits, the same "no stored derived state" philosophy as `getBalance` and the reporting tools.

## Future Considerations (Out of Scope)

- Inventing a tax-code mapping taxonomy beyond the existing chart of accounts (issue #5 scope is categorized export only, not full tax integration)
- Multi-currency and foreign-exchange handling
- Recurring transactions and period-end closings
- Sales tax, recurring invoices, and invoice overpayment/refund workflows (issue #23 scope is the core invoice lifecycle and AR aging only; a payment larger than an invoice's remaining balance is accepted as-is, with no refund flow)
